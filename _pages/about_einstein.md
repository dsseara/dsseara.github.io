I am a theoretical physicist studying complex, living systems from cells to societies.
In my work, I use tools from dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, hydrodynamics, and machine learning to ask how to understand these systems as materials?

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at University of Chicago in the James Franck institute working with [Vincenzo Vitelli](https://home.uchicago.edu/~vitelli/index.html). Prior to my postdoc, I received my Ph.D. from Yale University under [Michael Murrell](https://livingmatter.yale.edu).
