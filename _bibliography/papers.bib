  abstract      = {Systems with non-reciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform non-reciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the criticality of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a non-reciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its critical behavior by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spins types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects, but stabilized in three dimensions where non-reciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.},

  year          = {2023},
  month         = jul,
  abstract      = {Two hallmarks of non-equilibrium systems, from active colloids to animal herds, are agents motility and nonreciprocal interactions. Their interplay creates feedback loops leading to complex spatiotemporal dynamics crucial to understand and control the nonlinear response of active systems. Here, we introduce a minimal model that captures these two features at the microscopic scale, while admitting an exact hydrodynamic theory valid also in the fully-nonlinear regime. Our goal is to account for the fact that animal herds and colloidal swarms are rarely in the thermodynamic limit where particle number fluctuations can be completely ignored. Using statistical mechanics techniques we exactly coarse-grain a nonreciprocal microscopic model into a fluctuating hydrodynamics and use dynamical systems insights to analyze the resulting equations. In the absence of motility, we find two transitions to oscillatory phases occurring via distinct mechanisms: a Hopf bifurcation and a Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC) bifurcation. In the presence of motility, this rigorous approach, complemented by numerical simulations, allows us to quantitatively assess the hitherto neglected impact of inter-species nonreciprocity on a paradigmatic transition in active matter: the emergence of collective motion. When nonreciprocity is weak, we show that flocking is accelerated and bands tend to synchronize with a spatial overlap controlled by nonlinearities. When nonreciprocity is strong, flocking is superseded by a Chase & Rest dynamical phase where each species alternates between a chasing state, when they propagate, and a resting state, when they stand still. Finally, we demonstrate how fluctuations in finite systems can be harnessed to characterize microscopic non-reciprocity from macroscopic time-correlation functions, even in phases where nonreciprocal interactions do not affect the thermodynamic steady-state.},

  abstract      = {Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these relevant variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop a systematic approach based on the information bottleneck to identify the relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. Further, we show that in the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our information-based approach indicates when to optimally stop increasing the complexity of the reduced model. Furthermore, it provides a firm foundation to construct interpretable deep learning tools that perform model reduction. We illustrate how these tools work in practice by considering uncurated videos of atmospheric flows from which our algorithms automatically extract the dominant slow collective variables, as well as experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.},

  month         = dec,
  abstract      = {Living systems display complex behaviors driven not only by physical forces, but also decision-making guided by information processing and molded by cultural and/or biological evolution. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified, universal descriptions of these collective behaviors. However, incorporating the individual preferences of decision-making organisms into a hydrodynamic theory is an open problem. Here, we develop a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with utility functions that describe individual preferences in microeconomics. We show how to systematically validate the hypotheses underlying this construction from data using statistical tools based on neural networks. We illustrate this pipeline on the case study of human residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available, and show how trends in sociological surveys can be related to trends seen in racial segregation. In particular, we highlight that a history-dependence in the segregation-integration transition can arise even when agents have no memory. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of social-driven motility in real space from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.},
